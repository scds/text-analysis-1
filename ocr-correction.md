# Correcting OCR Errors

At present, the only way to achieve 100% accuracy with OCR text output is to manually correct each misspelled word. If your purposes can allow for some margin of error, however, the trade-offs of time for accuracy afforded by automated approaches are worthwhile. Numerous tools and strategies exist, requiring various levels of programming expertise. In the lesson that follows, we use OpenRefine - a spreadsheet-like software - to assist with identifying and correcting errors (i.e. still requires human ingenuity, but warp-powered).

Because many computational analysis methods for texts ultimately involve counting words, a misspelling here or there is not likely to impact your results significantly. Or if an error is consistent, it will become evident in the exploratory data analysis phase. It is important to acknowledge the limitations of not thoroughly correcting errors in the source texts, however.
