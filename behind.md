# Behind the Interface: The Language of Data Pre-processing

> **Behind the interface** examines the technocultural dimensions of working with (text) data, recognizing that computing infrastructure and practices are not neutral but historically constituted. By peering behind the interface at the power inequities , open up the field to critique and change.

## On "data cleaning"

Correcting a variety of errors in the dataset is often referred to as "data cleaning," suggesting that data - in the form it is received from its source - is disorderly or chaotic. In fact, OpenRefine advertises itself as a "powerful tool for cleaning messy data." 

In associating source data with messiness, a value-laden binary is created between data before pre-processing takes place and after. But, as we have already encountered in the "Pre-processing Digitized Texts" lesson, our pre-processing actions do not necessarily leave the data set improved: we may accidentally introduce new errors or make decisions to omit certain information from our analysis.

## Data is the new oil

You may also notice the use of metaphorical language that aligns data with unprocessed natural resources like oil or ore. For example, data mining or raw data or describing the data processing workflow as a pipeline.

In fact, data are never “raw” – they are always already determined by the choices we make in selecting them and the processes we use to transform them. And while we may use the language of the discipline in order to communicate with other practitioners, it is important to consider how language is used to frame thinking about data in particular ways that are grounded in a colonial paradigm of extraction.

When working with data, you may notice the use of metaphorical language that aligns data with unprocessed natural resources like oil or ore. For example, data mining, or raw data or describing the data processing workflow as a pipeline.
