# OCR Error Correction with Python

Although we have discussed how you can [export your pre-processing steps from OpenRefine](https://scds.github.io/text-analysis-1/output.html#extracting-the-pre-processing-steps-from-openrefine) to create a program of sorts in JSON, you may find it easier to perform your pre-processing tasks in Python if you are already familiar with programming concepts or if you would like to learn. Python has a number of natural language processing (NLP) libraries that can be used for exploratory data analysis as well.

The Sherman Centre's [Jay Brodeur](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/brodeujj) and [Alexandra Provo](https://library.nyu.edu/people/alexandra-provo/) of NYU Libraries have created a [Text Preparation and Analysis workshop](https://jasonbrodeur.github.io/dsi-text-prep/) with a section on [programmatic approaches with Python](https://jasonbrodeur.github.io/dsi-text-prep/python.html). The workshop also has a [tutorial on OpenRefine](https://jasonbrodeur.github.io/dsi-text-prep/open-refine.html) if you would like to further practice and build on the skills you have developed through the current workshop.
