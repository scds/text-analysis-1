# Pre-Processing Born-Digital Texts

Not all pre-processing of text data involves correcting OCR errors: working with text that was created in a digital format presents an entirely different set of challenges. Analyzing born-digital text data - extracted from PDFs, websites, social media platforms and so on - may require you to exclude dozens or even hundreds of other data points, change encodings, convert HTML entities, normalize values and more.

Although writing a program in Python or another language will accomplish some tasks more efficiently, OpenRefine is still incredibly useful when pre-processing born-digital text data as well. OpenRefine accepts JSON files, a format that many application programming interfaces (APIs) output, in addition to line-based text files that we have already worked with. Much of what you learned in the lesson on pre-processing digitized texts will have applications for born-digital text data, like splitting cells and isolating rows to limit the scope of your transformations.

A few additional features of OpenRefine may assist your pre-processing of born-digital text data:

## Removing columns



## Clustering similar cells

Clustering is useful where there are small but possibly (back to 

## Transpose rows across columns

Just as we can remove columns, we can also add them based on existing cell contents; for example, objects with multiple properties.
