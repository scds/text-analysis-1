# Learn More

If you would like to take your learning further, we have provided some additional resources below:

## OpenRefine

As we are using OpenRefine for our pre-processing tasks, having a better grasp of OpenRefine will assist your error correction effort! There are numerous tutorials available; the [Library Carpentries workshop on OpenRefine](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/) will reinforce your learning and gets into greater depth on some topics (though in a more general context - i.e. not specific to OCR error correction). 

You may also wish to refer to [the documentation for OpenRefine](https://docs.openrefine.org/) to really dive in to what's possible with the tool.

## Regular Expressions

Likewise, since one of the major OCR error correction strategies discussed involves using regular expressions (regex), a strong grasp of regex will help you make the most of OpenRefine. In addition to the resources listed on the "[Correcting OCR Errors with OpenRefine: Strategies](https://scds.github.io/text-analysis-1/or-strat.html#33-find-and-replace-with-regular-expressions-regex)" page: 

* Library Carpentries has also developed a [workshop on regex](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/),
* the [Rex Egg website](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html) offers both cheatsheets and comprehensive tutorials,
* Peter Green of Princeton University Library has developed a [regex cheatsheet tailored to OpenRefine](https://gist.github.com/pmgreen/6e133c5dcde65762d29c),
* another helpful resource, of course, is the [OpenRefine documentation](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/expressions#regular-expressions).

You can also dynamically test your regex patterns with [Regular Expressions 101](https://regex101.com/) or [Regexr](https://regexr.com/).

## Critical Data Studies

If "[Behind the Interface](behind.html)" piqued your curiosity about how language frames our understanding of data, you may be interested in the following texts:
